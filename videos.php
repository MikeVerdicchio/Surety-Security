                <h3>What Makes a Strong Password?</h3>
                <p>Whether you are logging into Facebook, paying your bills, or buying a dress on Amazon, passwords are critical to protecting sensitive data and personal information. Having a strong password for each website you use is increasingly important as more sensitive information is on-line and attacks are becoming more powerful.</p>

                <h3>What is Two-Factor Authentication?</h3>
                <p>Two Factor Authentication takes your Internet security to a whole new level by requiring two "keys" to get into your accounts. One key is something you <b>know</b> like your typical username/password combination. The second key is something you <b>have</b> such as a fingerprint or a randomly-generated code from an app on your smartphone.</p>

                <h3>Hashing and Password Storage</h3>
                <p>An important part of web development is safely storing users' credentials. The key is to use a one-way function, like hashing. Hashing is a cryptographic technique that takes a plaintext password and creates a random, fixed-length string of characters. This string, called a hash, is stored by the website instead of a plaintext or encrypted password.</p>

                <h3>What is Cross-Site Scripting?</h3>
                <p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a kind of injection attack in which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a website in order to inject malicious code that will attack visitors to the site. The injected code executes in the visitorâ€™s web browser, and appears to come from the trusted website.</p>

                <h3>Preventing Cross-Site Scripting Attacks</h3>
                <p>In general, the most important thing about preventing injection attacks is to adopt the mindset that nothing a user can control should be trusted. The two main ways to prevent XSS attacks are input validation and input transformation.</p>
