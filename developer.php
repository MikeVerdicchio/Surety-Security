                <h3>What is Password Hashing?</h3>
                <p>Password hashing is astronomical in keeping your users' information safe. Storing information in a database in plaintext can be devastating if that database gets hacked. Hashing passwords gives one more large layer of security between the hackers and users' information if something like that were to happen.</p>

                <h3>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h3>
                <p>Cross Site Scriping (XSS) is an injection attack in which a person enters in malicious code, usually Javascript, into a website by some means. Another person then views the website with the injected code which is then exucted as the browser can't really tell the difference between the malicious and real code.</p>
