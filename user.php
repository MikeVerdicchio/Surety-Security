                <h3>What Makes a Strong Password?</h3>
                <p>Whether you are logging into Facebook, paying your bills, or buying a dress on Amazon, passwords are critical to protecting sensitive data and personal information. Having a strong password for each website you use is increasingly important as more sensitive information is on-line and attacks are becoming more powerful.</p>

                <h3>What is Two-Factor Authentication?</h3>
                <p>Two Factor Authentication takes your Internet security to a whole new level by requiring two "keys" to get into your accounts. One key is something you <b>know</b> like your typical username/password combination. The second key is something you <b>have</b> such as a fingerprint or a randomly-generated code from an app on your smartphone.</p>
